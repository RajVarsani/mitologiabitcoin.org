          ## Introduction

          *"Bitcoin. It's borderless. It's decentralized. And it's
          going to end the world by releasing an endless stream
          of smoking hot CO2 into the atmosphere."*

          You've probably heard something like this a few times
          before. But is it true? Well, no. Not really. The truth
          is that bitcoin miners are like any other market
          participants: to last, they have to maximize
          efficiency. That means embracing green energy in a big
          way.

          This is the first volume in a series about bitcoin
          myths and the mythical creatures proliferating them.
          Since there are no more prominent or more prevalent
          myths about bitcoin than those having to do with its
          environmental impact, we started there.

          ## Scale-a-manders

          *"Bitcoin can't ssssssssssscale."*

          Scale-a-manders are among the oldest and most pervasive
          mythological bitcoin creatures. But despite their
          frequent claims to the contrary, bitcoin was designed
          to "sssscale" and scale a lot.

          That's because bitcoin transaction volume is
          independent of energy usage. This means that bitcoin
          can accommodate 100, 1,000, or even 10,000-fold more
          transactions without increasing its energy use.

        :markdown-it(html linkify typographer)
          *"Fee-fi-fo-fum. Bitcoin miners don't utilize green energy, son."*

          They're big. They're green. And they're right to be concerned
          about where bitcoin miners get their electricity. But bitcoin
          is actually greener than they (and most people) realize.

          In order to stay competitive, bitcoin miners must seek out
          abundant and inexpensive forms of energy. And there's no
          energy source more abundant or inexpensive than green energy.
          This means that any miner who wants to profit — whether they
          care about the environment or not—has to help squash bitcoin's
          carbon footprint.

          Far out, dude.

          ## Warewolves

          *"To recoup costs, bitcoin miners must run around the clock."*

          These dogged myths claim that bitcoin miners must run 24/7
          to recoup hardware costs. And they'd be right if this were
          2016. What they're missing is that hardware improvements
          naturally plateau over time, extending miner life cycles
          from 6 months to about four years (and climbing).

          This makes electricity the costliest part of mining,
          giving miners to shut down when costs rise and making
          bitcoin mining one of the only solutions to the renewable
          energy supply/demand mismatch problem. Low demand? Miners
          on. High demand? Miners off.

          ## Ent-a-cops

          *"Bitcoin's using too much ent-ergy!"*

          These mythological beasts can't see the woods for the
          trees—maybe that's because they are trees. Their beef
          with bitcoin: how much energy it consumes. Though they
          have good intentions, their concern is a little
          misplaced: it's CO2 that's the problem, not energy
          consumption.

          If bitcoin consumed 100x more energy but emitted zero
          CO2, would these worried sick-a-mores care? Probably
          not. And if demand for renewable energy did spike
          100-fold, so would investments in green technology. And
          that benefits everyone—specially trees.

          ## Ampires

          *"That electricity belongs elsewhere. Like Transylvania."*

          These undying myths want energy consumed by bitcoin
          allocated to other green initiatives like electric
          vehicles. Hey, we like electric cars. But what they don't
          know is that renewable energy consumed by bitcoin rarely
          has other customers—not even one.

          It's either unwanted due to transportation and storage
          costs, or it just isn't in demand. If there are customers
          for that energy, then it goes to the highest bidder. In
          almost all cases, bitcoin miners won't be the highest
          bidders. So put away the stake.

          ## Fiat Fairies

          *"Bitcoin consumes more energy than traditional currencies."*

          The truth about government-issued currencies is that they
          aren't backed by much more than a promise. And when they
          are, the things that back them are militaries, police
          forces, arcane legal systems, unaccountable banks, and
          mints they can fire up at will.

          All of these things consume vast amounts of energy—and
          it's rarely green. When bitcoin becomes the planet's
          preferred currency, it will come at the expense of
          fiat-dependent systems like these. And once they're gone,
          like real fairies, you'll probably never see them again.
